# Layout contract

Every layout in the theme, its slots, its props, and the things that bite.
Self-contained on purpose: the theme installs as an npm package, so none of its
own source or demo decks are at hand while you are writing a deck.

## Contents

- [The headline rule](#the-headline-rule) — applies to every layout
- [cover](#cover) · [section](#section) · [agenda](#agenda) · [default](#default)
- [quadrants](#quadrants) · [two-cols](#two-cols) · [two-cols-header](#two-cols-header)
- [statement](#statement) · [contact](#contact) · [conversation](#conversation)
- [What the theme will not do](#what-the-theme-will-not-do)

## The headline rule

Every layout takes its headline from the markdown flow — the first heading on
the slide, before any `::slot::` marker. There is no `title:` prop anywhere.

How that heading is rendered differs, and this is the part people get wrong:

| Layout | The first heading becomes |
|---|---|
| `default` `agenda` `quadrants` `contact` `conversation` | Content headline — uppercase, 3.445rem, weight 400 |
| `cover` | *Titel* — far larger, uppercase |
| `section` | *Titel*, centred vertically |
| `statement` | A sentence, upright, white, **bold runs go yellow** |
| `two-cols` | Nothing special — it has no headline slot at all |

A slide is a Vue template once Slidev has parsed the markdown, so anything in
angle brackets is read as a component tag, not as text. `<Firstname Lastname>`
renders as nothing at all. Write placeholders plain.

---

## cover

Title slide. Cheetah bleeds off the left edge; the title column starts at ~34%.

```md
---
layout: cover
---

# Titel

## Untertitel

Firstname Lastname

City, dd.MM.yyyy
```

- First heading is the *Titel*, second is the *Untertitel* — both uppercased.
- Every paragraph after the headings drops to the bottom-left *Name / Datum* block.
- No props.

## section

Divider between chapters ("Zwischenfolie"). Shares the cover's background.

```md
---
layout: section
variant: ascii
---

# Migration
```

- `variant`: `cheetah` (default) or `ascii`, the same face cropped flush left.
  There is no third value — the sujet is brand artwork, not a per-slide choice.
- Heading is centred vertically at *Titel* size, not the content headline size.

## agenda

Headline plus numbered `// n` entries. The numbers are positional, so
reordering the list renumbers it; nothing to configure.

```md
---
layout: agenda
---

# Agenda

- Ausgangslage
- Zielbild
- Migrationspfad
```

- Six entries fill one column. The seventh starts a second column automatically.
- Twelve is the maximum. Each half is only ~27rem wide — keep split entries terse.
- Bullet lists and ordered lists render identically.

## default

The standard content slide, and the right answer unless a slide genuinely needs
a different shape. Headline, then ordinary markdown.

- Bullets take the yellow `//` marker; nested bullets step down and dim.
- **Bold** carries brand yellow, *italic* stays white.
- Tables, ordered lists, blockquotes and fenced code are all styled — see
  [Code and prose](#code-and-prose).

## quadrants

Headline plus four blocks on a 2×2 raster, filled in reading order.

```md
---
layout: quadrants
---

# Themenfelder

::one::

### Architektur
Strangler-Grenze um die JSF-Shell.

::two::

### Security
Keycloak ab dem ersten Service.
```

- Slots `::one::` … `::four::`. Supply only `::one::` and `::two::` and you get
  the top row and nothing else — the empty ones cost no space.
- Any heading level works as the subheading; the layout sets them all alike.
- The `//` before a subheading is drawn by the layout. Write the text plain.
- Paragraphs inside a block run at uniform line pitch with no gap between them.
  That is deliberate, not an oversight — use a second block or a `//` list when
  copy needs to be set apart.
- A block that outgrows its box deepens its row rather than spilling into the
  one below.

## two-cols

Slidev's own slot contract, honoured exactly.

```md
---
layout: two-cols
---

### Legacy

::right::

### Ziel
```

- Everything before `::right::` is the left column. `::left::` is accepted as an
  explicit name for it.
- **No headline spans the columns.** That is the whole difference from
  `two-cols-header` — reach for that one instead of trying to fake a headline here.
- Takes the `class` and `layoutClass` props Slidev's built-in passes.

## two-cols-header

Headline across both columns, then the two halves, then an optional bottom row.

```md
---
layout: two-cols-header
---

# Vorher / Nachher

::left::

### Vorher

::right::

### Nachher

::bottom::

Beide Pfade laufen sechs Wochen parallel.
```

- The default slot (before `::left::`) is the spanning headline.
- `::bottom::` is anchored to the bottom of the slide. Leave it out and it
  costs no space.
- Takes the `class` and `layoutClass` props Slidev's built-in passes. As in the
  built-in, `class` lands on the two columns and the bottom row only — the
  headline is not styled by it. Use `layoutClass` when you need to reach the
  whole slide, headline included.

## statement

One bold line, no cheetah. Use it to land a point, or to close a deck when
there is no person to put on a `contact` slide.

```md
---
layout: statement
---

# Migration ist ein Weg, kein **Ereignis.**
```

- Set upright and white; the **bold** runs take the brand yellow.

## contact

Closing slide. Everything except the person is filled in already.

| Prop | Default |
|---|---|
| `name` `role` `photo` `email` `phone` | — |
| `photoPath` | `public/contact.jpg` |
| `company` | `Gepardec IT Services GmbH` |
| `locations` | Wien + Linz |
| `web` | `www.gepardec.com` |
| `social` | `true` — set `false` to drop the badge row |
| `linkedin` `xing` `facebook` `instagram` | — |

```md
---
layout: contact
name: Firstname Lastname
role: Role
email: firstname.lastname@gepardec.com
phone: +43 000 000 000
locations:
  - { label: 'City', address: 'Street 1, 0000 City' }
  - { label: 'City', address: 'Street 2, 0000 City' }
---

# Kontakt aufnehmen

::note::

Ein Satz unter den Badges.
```

- A heading replaces the default `Kontakt`; `::note::` adds a line under the badges.
- Badges with a URL become links; the rest stay plain, as in print.
- `locations` is a list of `{ label, address }`, rendered as `// <label>: <address>`.

## conversation

An agent session as a rolling transcript window. The slide is a fixed viewport
onto a taller stack of turns; each click reveals the next turn and slides the
stack up, so history scrolls off the top under a gradient.

layout: conversation
session: OrderService migration

# Getting the build green

::turns::

<ChatTurn role="user">

The checkout suite fails one run in five on CI. Never locally.

</ChatTurn>

<ChatTurn role="agent" v-click>

The assertion races the toast animation.

</ChatTurn>

<ChatTurn role="tool" meta="npm test — 50 runs" v-click>

```
✓ checkout › places the order   50 passed
```

</ChatTurn>
````

**Layout prop**

- `session` — shown bottom-left beside the turn counter. A session name or date.

**`<ChatTurn>` props**

- `role` — `user`, `agent` or `tool`. Drives the whole visual treatment: the
  user's turn gets the loud 3px rule and a yellow wash, the agent's a hairline
  rule and an indent, so the two read apart before colour registers.
- `who` — overrides the role cap, e.g. `who="Alex"` instead of `You`.
- `meta` — a muted note beside the cap: a timestamp, a model, a token count.

**The four things that bite**

1. **Blank lines inside `<ChatTurn>` are load-bearing.** Without a blank line
   after the opening tag and before the closing one, markdown-it parses the
   body as raw HTML and none of the markdown renders.
2. **Export with `--with-clicks`.** Each click is its own PDF page. Without the
   flag the PDF gets one page per slide with the history already scrolled off —
   the crop is meant to be temporal, not lossy.
3. **A turn taller than the viewport can never be shown in full.** The stack
   scrolls its bottom into view and the top is gone, on screen and in print
   alike. In dev the layout warns in the console and outlines the turn in red.
   Split it across two `<ChatTurn>` blocks on consecutive clicks.
4. **Pacing is Slidev's own `v-click`.** The layout registers no clicks itself —
   it reads the classes the directive leaves on the DOM. Whatever you write
   (one turn per click, two at once, a `v-click` range) is what the tape
   follows. The opening turn carries no `v-click` so it is on screen when the
   slide arrives.

Six to ten turns is the working range. Past that the audience loses the thread —
they read the current turn and skim the two above it.

## Code and prose

- Fenced blocks use the theme's Shiki setup. Line highlights go in braces after
  the language: ` ```java {4-5} `. The band spans the full block width.
- Magic-move keeps a single border through the animation.
- `inline code` is JetBrains Mono; links are yellow with a dim underline.
- Blockquotes get a yellow left bar — the theme draws no bordered content boxes
  anywhere, so a blockquote is how you set a line apart.

## What the theme will not do

Worth knowing before proposing a workaround:

- **No bordered content boxes.** Not on any layout. If content needs separating,
  use a `//` list, a second quadrant block, or a blockquote.
- **No headline on `two-cols`.** Use `two-cols-header`.
- **No third `section` variant.**
- **No `!important`, no reaching into Slidev internals, no invented escape
  hatches.** The theme is built on official Slidev bindings only, and layouts
  that share a built-in's name honour that built-in's slot contract. A change
  that needs an internals hack is a change that needs a different design.
